# Wana work with us [Voluenteer, Paying later on]
You are required to study all fields of physics, depths must cover 
- Quantum Electrodynamics [Mech + EMag] (QED) (Our semiconductor research projects [Wont start until resources are avalible])
- Classical Electromagnetism (General usage of electronics)
- Quantum Atomics
- Accoustics
- Optics

Other fields of physics are needed, except biological, and astronomical.

# Why [Physic]?
We want all engineers to be avalible on demand for any work resource + integration support, as multiple "modules" will be able to integrate together no matter what team

# Liquistics?
- English 2023+ [Will Obesolete]
- Moroccan Arabic (Optional) [Gulf Arabic based languages are good too]
